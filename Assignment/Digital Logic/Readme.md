## Digital Logic

### 1. Define the Number System with an example
A number system is a system for representing numbers using a set of symbols and rules for combining them. An example of a number system is the decimal number system, which uses the symbols 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, and the rule that the position of a digit determines its value (e.g., the number "42" represents 4 tens and 2 ones). This is the most common number system used in everyday life.

### 2. Define codes such as ASCII, Gray, BCD, and XS-3 with examples
ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is a code that assigns a unique number to each of the characters used in the English language, including letters, numbers, and special characters. For example, the letter "A" is represented by the number 65 in ASCII, while the number "0" is represented by the number 48.

Gray code is a code that assigns a unique binary code to each number such that only one bit changes at a time as the numbers increase. It is used in some digital circuits to minimize the number of changes in the signal. For example, the binary representation of 0 is 000 and the gray code representation is 000; the binary representation of 1 is 001 and the gray code representation is 001; the binary representation of 2 is 010 and the gray code representation is 011, the binary representation of 3 is 011 and the gray code representation is 010

BCD (Binary-coded decimal) is a code that represents decimal numbers using four bits for each digit. For example, the decimal number "1234" would be represented as 0001 0010 0011 0100 in BCD.

XS-3 is a code that was created to minimize the number of bits required to represent a decimal digit. It uses 3 bits to represent decimal digits from 0 to 9. For example, the decimal number "5" would be represented as "101" in XS-3.
