## Constructor and Destructor

Construtor and Destructor are special class member function in C++ where, classname and method names are same and for destructors we use the symbol (~) infornt of classname.

### Example

```cpp
class class_name {
    //private data members
    //public data members

    //Constructor 
    class_name(parameter_list(s)) {
        //constructor body
    }
};
```
