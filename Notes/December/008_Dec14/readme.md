## Dynamic Memory Allocation

In C++, it allows us to allocate memory for a variable or for an array at runtime. This is called Dynamic Memory Allocation. <br/>
In this case, we use new and delete operator. <br/> Dynamic Memory Allocation can make memory management more efficient. <br/>
For arrays, It is efficient when the time of runtime in which we dont know the size of the array until execuition.
