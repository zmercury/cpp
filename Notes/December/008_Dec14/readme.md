## Dynamic Memory Allocation

In C++, it allows us to allocate memory for a variable or for an array at runtime. This is called Dynamic Memory Allocation. <br/>
In this case, we use new and delete operator. <br/> Dynamic Memory Allocation can make memory management more efficient. <br/>
For arrays, It is efficient when the time of runtime in which we dont know the size of the array until execuition. 

#### New Operator

This operator specifies a memory allocation. If there is sufficient memeory for a new operator, initializes the memory and returns the newly allocated and initialized memory address for the pointer variable. 

##### Syntax

```cpp
pointer_variable = new data_type;
```
